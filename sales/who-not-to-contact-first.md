# Who NOT to Contact First (Very Important)

**This saves you months of wasted cycles, protects confidence, and preserves the press posture you've worked so hard to build.**

---

## ❌ 1. Central Procurement Teams (Early)

**Why not now:**

- They buy categories, not judgement
- They demand frameworks, portals, KPIs
- They will ask:
  - "What benchmark do you meet?"
  - "What outcomes do you guarantee?"

**This forces you to explain instead of operate.**

**Rule:**
Procurement comes after an internal sponsor wants you.

---

## ❌ 2. Legal Departments as First Entry Point

**Why not now:**

- Legal doesn't commission; they constrain
- They evaluate risk without context
- Early exposure invites:
  - hypotheticals
  - over-lawyering
  - defensive reframing

**Legal should react to the artefact, not define it.**

---

## ❌ 3. Organisations in Active Disputes or Investigations

**Red flag phrases:**

- "We're being challenged…"
- "This already happened…"
- "We need to show…"

**They want retroactive justification, not assurance.**

**Rule:**
If outcomes are already known → refuse.

---

## ❌ 4. Consultants, Coaches, or Training Vendors (Initially)

**Why not now:**

- They feel threatened by neutrality
- They want endorsement or validation
- They'll ask to "collaborate" or "co-brand"

**That compromises independence.**

**You may work with them later — never first.**

---

## ❌ 5. Early-Stage Startups or Founder-Led Teams

**Why not now:**

- Decisions are informal
- Intent is fluid
- Records feel premature to them

**Your service shines where process already exists.**

---

## ❌ 6. Organisations Asking for "Impact", "ROI", or "Proof"

**If they ask early:**

- "How does this show impact?"
- "What does this prove?"
- "How does this help us justify spend?"

**They are not ready for a press.**

**Your answer should be:**

"That's not what we do."

**And you move on.**

---

## ✅ WHO YOU SHOULD CONTACT FIRST (For Context)

**This sharpens the "do not" list.**

**Target:**

- HR Directors
- Heads of L&D / OD
- People Partners
- Governance-aware leaders

**Organisations with:**

- board oversight
- regulatory exposure
- leadership churn
- recent or upcoming programmes

**They already feel the pain.**

---

## THE GOLDEN FILTER (Use This)

**Before contacting anyone, ask:**

**"Will this person feel relief when the record exists?"**

**If the answer is no → don't contact them yet.**

---

## WHAT THIS UNLOCKS

**By avoiding the wrong targets:**

- pricing holds
- confidence stays high
- doctrine doesn't drift
- refusals feel natural
- the service stays rare

**This is how quiet, durable B2B infra grows.**
