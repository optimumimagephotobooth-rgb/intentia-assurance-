# PDR Live Intake Call — Final Rehearsal

**Target length:** 15–20 minutes

**Operator mindset:** Court recorder, not facilitator

---

## OPENING (45 seconds)

**Your wife should say exactly this:**

"Intentia Assurance creates independent decision records.

We document why a programme was commissioned at the time the decision was made.

This is not an evaluation, and it does not assess decision quality."

**Then stop.**

---

## EXPECTED RESPONSE

Usually:
- "Okay"
- "That sounds useful"
- "Can you explain how it works?"

---

## HOW IT WORKS (60 seconds)

"We capture decision context and intent, you confirm accuracy, we freeze the record, and we generate a final PDF.

Once frozen, nothing is changed or added."

**Stop.**

---

## TRANSITION TO INTAKE

"If that's acceptable, I'll walk through the intake questions.

They're factual and should take about 10 minutes."

**This frames the call as procedural, not consultative.**

---

## INTAKE EXECUTION (Operator discipline)

**She:**
- reads the questions
- types exactly what is said
- does not paraphrase
- does not react to content

**If they ask:**

"What do you think?"

**She answers:**

"We don't assess or advise — we only record."

---

## FREEZE BOUNDARY (Critical)

"I'll send you the compiled record for confirmation.

Once you confirm accuracy, the record is frozen.

Any corrections would require a new record."

**If they resist:**

"That constraint is what gives the record authority."

---

## PRICE (Only if asked)

"The fee is £750 per decision record."

**Then silence.**

---

## CLOSE

"I'll send the confirmation email later today."

**Call ends.**

**No follow-ups. No selling.**

---

## FINAL POSITIONING (ONE SENTENCE)

**This is the only sentence she needs to remember:**

"We freeze decision intent before outcomes exist."

**That's it.**
