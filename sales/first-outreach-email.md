## Email Body (Use Verbatim)

Hello [Name],

I'm reaching out because you recently ran or commissioned a leadership or management training programme.

Intentia Assurance produces independent, time-bound assurance records that document what a training programme was intended to do, what was delivered, and what it was not intended to guarantee.

This is not an evaluation or impact assessment. It's a neutral, standalone PDF designed to remain credible under audit, grievance, or review.

If this sounds potentially useful, I'm happy to explain briefly.

Kind regards,
[Name]
Intentia Assurance
