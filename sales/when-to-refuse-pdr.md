# When to Refuse a PDR Request

**Refusal is what makes this press credible.**

Your wife must refuse — calmly — in the following cases.

---

## ❌ REFUSE IF: Outcomes Are Already Known

**If the client says:**
- "This already happened…"
- "We want to document why we chose this after the results"
- "We're being challenged now and need a record"

**She says:**

"We wouldn't be the right service for that.

A Programme Decision Record only works if created before outcomes exist."

**Then stop.**

**This refusal builds trust, not friction.**

## ❌ REFUSE IF: They Want to Improve the Story

**If they say:**
- "Can we word this more carefully?"
- "Can we remove this part?"
- "Can we make it sound stronger?"

**She says:**

"We don't optimise or reshape decisions.

We only record what was understood at the time."

**If they persist:**

"Then this service wouldn't be appropriate."

## ❌ REFUSE IF: They Want Evaluation or Justification

**If they ask:**
- "Does this show we made the right decision?"
- "Can this demonstrate compliance or good governance?"

**She says:**

"No — it doesn't assess decision quality or correctness.

It preserves context and intent only."

## ❌ REFUSE IF: They Want Backdating

**If they say:**
- "Can we date this earlier?"
- "The decision was informal at the time…"

**She says:**

"We can only record decisions as they are understood and confirmed at the time of intake."

**No exceptions.**

## Key Principle

**Refusal protects credibility.**

A press that accepts everything is not a press.

It's a service that will be questioned.
