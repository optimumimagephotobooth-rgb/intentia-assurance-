# Call Discipline Checklist

## Before the Call

- [ ] Review the simulation script
- [ ] Remember: orienting, not pitching
- [ ] Prepare to let silence sit

## During the Call

- [ ] Use exact responses (don't improvise)
- [ ] Stop after each answer
- [ ] Do not fill silence
- [ ] Do not justify or oversell
- [ ] Do not explain hashing unless asked

## After the Call

- [ ] Did you avoid selling?
- [ ] Did you avoid adding features?
- [ ] Did you avoid reassurance?
- [ ] Did the client feel calmer, not excited?

## If Nerves Hit

**Remember this line:**

"We don't improve the story — we freeze the version that existed."
