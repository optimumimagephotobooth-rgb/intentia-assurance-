# First Client Call — Rehearsal Script

## Opening (30 seconds)

"Intentia Assurance creates independent assurance records for leadership and management programmes.

We capture what training was intended to do, what was delivered, and what it was not intended to guarantee."

**Stop.**

## Common Questions and Answers

### "Why would we need this?"

"Training often gets reinterpreted later — during audits, grievances, or leadership changes.

This creates a fixed record that prevents that drift."

### "Is this an evaluation?"

"No. We don't assess effectiveness or outcomes.

We only document intent, delivery, and boundaries."

### "How does it work?"

"We collect information, you confirm it, we freeze it, and we generate a final PDF.

Nothing changes after that."

### "What's the price?"

"£500 per programme record."

**Then silence.**

### "Can you customise it for us?"

"We don't customise the structure — consistency is what makes it credible."

**That answer builds trust.**
