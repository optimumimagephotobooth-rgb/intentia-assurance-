# Simulation — First Inbound Call

**Training Assurance Pack (Primary Press)**

**Context:** The client replied: "This sounds interesting. Can you explain a bit more?"

**Call length:** 15–20 minutes

**Stakeholder:** HR Director / Head of L&D

**Operator mindset:** You are not pitching. You are orienting.

## OPENING (Client speaks first)

**Client:**
"Thanks for taking the call. I saw your email and wanted to understand what you actually do."

**Correct response (use verbatim):**
"Of course. Intentia Assurance creates independent assurance records for training programmes.

We document what a programme was intended to do, what was delivered, and what it was not intended to guarantee."

**Then stop.**

**Silence here is correct.**

---

## CLIENT QUESTION 1 — "Why would we need this?"

**Client:**
"We already have training records internally — why would we need something external?"

**Correct response:**
"Internal records are usually written by people who later become stakeholders in what the training is said to mean.

We create a neutral record that doesn't evolve when questions arise later."

**Stop.**

---

## CLIENT QUESTION 2 — "Is this an evaluation?"

**Client:**
"So is this like an evaluation or effectiveness review?"

**Correct response:**
"No. We don't assess effectiveness, impact, or outcomes.

We only document intent, delivery, and boundaries."

**Stop.**

---

## CLIENT QUESTION 3 — "What do we actually get?"

**Client:**
"What's the final output?"

**Correct response:**
"A standalone PDF that can be shared, archived, or relied on independently.

There's no portal or ongoing system."

**This reassures procurement and legal immediately.**

---

## CLIENT QUESTION 4 — "What's the process?"

**Client:**
"How does it work in practice?"

**Correct response (60 seconds max):**
"We collect information and materials from you, you confirm they're accurate, we freeze the record, and we generate the final PDF.

Once frozen, nothing changes."

**Stop.**

---

## CLIENT QUESTION 5 — "What if we want to change something?"

**Client:**
"What if we need to tweak wording later?"

**Correct response (boundary test):**
"Then it wouldn't belong in the same record.

Corrections require a new record — that constraint is what gives it credibility."

**If they accept this, you're in.**

---

## CLIENT QUESTION 6 — "How much does it cost?"

**Client:**
"And the cost?"

**Correct response:**
"£500 per programme record."

**Then silence.**

**If they say "Okay" — proceed.**
**If they hesitate — let them.**

---

## NATURAL CLOSE (Operator-controlled)

"If this feels useful, the next step would be a short intake call where we capture the information.

I can send a summary and confirmation afterwards."

**Do not push a date unless they ask.**

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**The call is a success if:**

- no selling occurred
- no features were added
- no reassurance was given
- the client feels calmer, not excited
- they say: "Yes, let's try this for the next programme."

---

## COMMON FAILURE MODES (AVOID THESE)

**Do not:**

- explain hashing unless asked
- justify the price
- talk about protection or legal safety
- say "clients love this"
- overshare future use cases
- rush silence

## ONE LINE TO REMEMBER IF NERVES HIT

**"We don't improve the story — we freeze the version that existed."**

**That line will carry you through any call.**
