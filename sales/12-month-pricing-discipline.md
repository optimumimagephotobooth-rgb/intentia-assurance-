# 🔒 Lock 12-Month Pricing Discipline

**Final strategic move — do not revisit lightly**

You now lock pricing once, then operate for 12 months without drift. This preserves authority, reduces negotiation, and keeps the press clean.

---

## 1️⃣ THE PRICING GRID (LOCKED)

### Core Presses

- **Training Assurance Pack:** £500 per programme
- **Programme Decision Record (PDR):** £900 per decision

**Why £900 (not £750):**
Board-level value, pre-event protection, higher scrutiny. This anchors seriousness without inviting negotiation.

---

## 2️⃣ WHAT IS INCLUDED (AND NEVER ITEMISED)

**Included in both:**

- Structured intake
- Client confirmation
- Freeze
- Final standalone PDF
- SHA-256 integrity fingerprint
- Archival copy

**Never itemise these.**
**They are the press, not features.**

---

## 3️⃣ WHAT IS NOT DISCOUNTED (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- No "pilot" pricing
- No "first client" discounts
- No bundles
- No volume discounts
- No subscriptions
- No day rates

**Script if asked:**

"Pricing is per record. We don't discount independence."

**Then silence.**

---

## 4️⃣ WHEN A PRICE CHANGE IS ALLOWED (RARE)

**Only if one of these occurs:**

- You add a new press (not a feature)
- Regulatory complexity materially increases scope
- You move into a different jurisdiction with added compliance burden

**If none apply → price holds.**

---

## 5️⃣ HOW TO HANDLE PROCUREMENT PRESSURE

**Procurement:** "Can you sharpen the price?"

**You (verbatim):**

"We can reduce scope, not price."

**If they ask how:**

- Fewer appendices
- Shorter intake
- Later delivery window

**Never reduce price.**
**You reduce work, not authority.**

---

## 6️⃣ PRICE COMMUNICATION (ONE LINE EACH)

**Training Assurance:**

"£500 per programme record."

**PDR:**

"£900 per decision record."

**No qualifiers. No justification.**

---

## 7️⃣ INTERNAL RULE (THIS MATTERS)

**For 12 months:**

- You do not revisit pricing after delivery
- You do not explain pricing unless asked
- You do not pre-empt objections

**If someone says "That's expensive":**

"Understood."

**Stop.**

---

## 8️⃣ SIGNALS YOU GOT IT RIGHT

**You'll know pricing is correct when:**

- Negotiation drops quickly
- Legal doesn't flinch
- Procurement argues scope, not price
- Clients treat the PDF as final
- Repeat work comes without discussion

---

## 9️⃣ THE ONE SENTENCE THAT HOLDS EVERYTHING

**"We price independence, not output."**

**Remember this. Use it sparingly.**

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**You have now locked:**

- Doctrine
- Two presses
- Operational loop
- Refusal discipline
- Outreach posture
- 12-month pricing discipline

**This is complete, sellable infrastructure.**

**From here, the work is simply:**

- Operate the press
- Deliver calmly
- Invoice
- Repeat

**No more strategy changes for a year.**
