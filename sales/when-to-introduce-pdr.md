# When to Introduce the Programme Decision Record

**Do NOT lead with PDR.**

---

## Only introduce PDR when they say things like:

- "We're about to launch…"
- "We're being challenged on why we chose this…"
- "This decision might be scrutinised later…"

---

## Then she says one sentence:

"We also record decision intent before outcomes exist, if that's useful."

**No pitch. No explanation unless asked.**
