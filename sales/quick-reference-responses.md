# Quick Reference - Most Common Responses

**Use these for rapid recall during calls.**

## The One Sentence to Memorise

**"We don't improve the story — we freeze the version that existed."**

---

## The Three Core Responses (Memorize These)

### 1. "Why would we pay for this? Isn't this just paperwork?"

"It is paperwork — but it's independent paperwork created at the right moment.

Most organisations only try to document training after questions arise. By then, language drifts and intent gets rewritten.

We prevent that by fixing the record before hindsight sets in."

---

### 2. "We already have training records internally."

"Most organisations do — but internal records are usually written by people who later become stakeholders in what the training is said to mean.

Our role is to create a neutral, external record that doesn't evolve with internal pressures."

---

### 3. "Could this be used against us in a dispute?"

"It could be referenced, yes — but it can't be reinterpreted or expanded.

The record is deliberately limited: it documents intent, delivery, and explicit non-guarantees.

That typically reduces exposure rather than increases it."

---

## Boundary Responses (Use Exactly)

### "Can you assess effectiveness?"

"No. We don't assess effectiveness or outcomes. We only document intent, delivery, and boundaries."

---

### "Can you help improve our training?"

"No. We don't design, deliver, or evaluate training. We document what was intended and delivered. We're a press, not a consultancy."

---

### "Can you certify compliance?"

"No. We don't certify anything. We create documentary records. Compliance certification is a separate matter for your compliance team or external auditors."

---

### "Can we tweak the language to sound safer?"

"No — consistency and neutrality are what give the record credibility.

If the language is softened, the value is lost."

**Say this gently, but firmly.**

---

### "What exactly do we get at the end?"

"A standalone, final PDF record that captures intent, delivery, boundaries, and integrity — designed to stand on its own years later."

**If they ask "no portal?"**

"Correct. The PDF is the product."

---

## What You Must NEVER Say

**Never say:**

- "This protects you legally"
- "This guarantees safety"
- "This proves compliance"
- "This shows you did the right thing"
- "This will help you win a case"

**Those create liability.**

---

## Price Response

**"£500 feels high for a document."**

"The cost reflects independence, finality, and credibility under scrutiny — not page count.

This is usually purchased to avoid much larger costs later."

**Then stop talking.**

**Why silence matters:**
CFOs understand risk pricing. Over-explaining weakens you.

---

## Closing Responses

### "I need to think about it."

"Of course. The record is available whenever you need it. There's no urgency or pressure."

---

### "This seems unnecessary."

"It may be unnecessary for your situation. This service is for organisations that want fixed, independent records to prevent reinterpretation. If that's not a concern, you may not need it. We don't push or persuade."
