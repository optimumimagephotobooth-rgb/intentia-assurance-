# Quick Reference - Most Common Responses

**Use these for rapid recall during calls.**

## The Three Core Responses (Memorize These)

### 1. "Why should we pay for this?"

"Internal documentation isn't independent. This creates a fixed, independent record that survives scrutiny. The £500 is for the independence and the freeze — once confirmed, nothing changes."

---

### 2. "Isn't this just paperwork?"

"It's procedural assurance, not paperwork. The difference is the freeze mechanism and independence declaration. Once frozen, the record can't be reinterpreted. That prevents training from being retroactively judged against outcomes it was never intended to guarantee."

---

### 3. "What if this is used against us?"

"The record documents what training was intended to do and what it was not intended to guarantee. It includes explicit counterfactual boundaries. If training is later questioned, the record shows what was promised and what wasn't. That protects you from claims that training was supposed to do something it wasn't designed for."

---

## Boundary Responses (Use Exactly)

### "Can you assess effectiveness?"

"No. We don't assess effectiveness or outcomes. We only document intent, delivery, and boundaries."

---

### "Can you help improve our training?"

"No. We don't design, deliver, or evaluate training. We document what was intended and delivered. We're a press, not a consultancy."

---

### "Can you certify compliance?"

"No. We don't certify anything. We create documentary records. Compliance certification is a separate matter for your compliance team or external auditors."

---

### "Can you customise this?"

"We don't customise the structure. Consistency is what makes records credible. The content comes from your information, but the structure is fixed."

---

## Price Response

**"What's the price?"**

"£500 per programme record."

**Then silence.**

---

## Closing Responses

### "I need to think about it."

"Of course. The record is available whenever you need it. There's no urgency or pressure."

---

### "This seems unnecessary."

"It may be unnecessary for your situation. This service is for organisations that want fixed, independent records to prevent reinterpretation. If that's not a concern, you may not need it. We don't push or persuade."
