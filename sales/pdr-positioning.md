# Programme Decision Record - Positioning Guide

## What It Is (One Sentence)

"The Programme Decision Record captures why a programme was commissioned before outcomes exist — so that intent and boundaries aren't rewritten later."

## When to Offer It

**Never lead with PDR.**

Offer it:
- After a Training Assurance Pack has been delivered
- When a client says "we're about to launch..."
- When a client mentions a new programme being commissioned

**How to introduce it:**

"We can also record the decision context before you start."

That's all.

## Pricing

**Programme Decision Record: £750–£1,000**

**Why higher?**
- Board-level value
- Higher stakes
- Pre-event protection

**Do not bundle initially.**

## What It Protects Against

- Hindsight bias
- "Why didn't you choose X instead?"
- "You should have foreseen this"
- Leadership blame after change/failure
- Regulatory second-guessing
- Board turnover reinterpretation

## Who Values This

- Senior leadership
- Boards
- HR / L&D
- Risk & compliance

## Key Discipline

**The PDR is created:**
- Before programme delivery begins
- Or at the point of commissioning

**It should never be created after outcomes are known.**

That timing is the value.

## Final Truth

The Programme Decision Record is not paperwork.

It is: **time-frozen executive memory.**

That is rare. That is valuable.
