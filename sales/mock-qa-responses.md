# Mock Client Q&A - Locked Responses

This document contains exact responses to hard questions, tested and locked.

**Principle:** Calm, direct, boundary-maintaining. No overselling, no defensiveness.

## Role 1: Sceptical HR Director

### Question 1: "Why should we pay £500 for this? We can document our training internally."

**Response:**
"Internal documentation is valuable, but it's not independent. When training gets reinterpreted during audits, grievances, or leadership changes, internal records can be questioned.

This creates a fixed, independent record that survives scrutiny. The £500 is for the independence and the freeze — once confirmed, nothing changes, which internal processes can't guarantee."

---

### Question 2: "Isn't this just expensive paperwork?"

**Response:**
"It's procedural assurance, not paperwork. The difference is the freeze mechanism and independence declaration.

Once frozen, the record can't be reinterpreted. That prevents training from being retroactively judged against outcomes it was never intended to guarantee. Internal documentation doesn't have that protection."

---

### Question 3: "What if this record is used against us in a grievance or legal case?"

**Response:**
"The record documents what training was intended to do and what it was not intended to guarantee. It includes explicit counterfactual boundaries.

If training is later questioned, the record shows what was promised and what wasn't. That protects you from claims that training was supposed to do something it wasn't designed for."

---

### Question 4: "Why can't we just write a memo ourselves?"

**Response:**
"A memo can be rewritten. This record is frozen and independently verifiable. Once confirmed, it cannot be modified.

Also, a memo written internally lacks the independence declaration. Under scrutiny, internal memos can be dismissed as self-serving. This record has an explicit independence statement."

---

### Question 4a: "But our internal documentation is also 'fixed' — we don't change it. So what's the real difference?"

**Response:**
"The difference is independence and verifiability. Internal documentation, even if you don't change it, can be questioned as self-serving under scrutiny.

This record has an explicit independence declaration and a cryptographic hash that enables independent verification. Anyone can verify the hash to confirm the record hasn't been modified. That credibility doesn't exist with internal documentation."

---

## Role 2: Legal / Compliance Lead

### Question 5: "What legal protection does this actually provide?"

**Response:**
"This is not legal protection. It's procedural documentation. It creates a fixed record of intent and scope at a point in time.

If a dispute arises, the record shows what training was intended to do and what it was not intended to guarantee. That can be useful evidence, but we don't provide legal advice or guarantees."

---

### Question 6: "Can this be used in court or tribunal proceedings?"

**Response:**
"The record can be submitted as evidence, but we don't guarantee its admissibility or weight. That's a legal question for your legal advisors.

What we provide is a fixed, independently verifiable record with a cryptographic hash. Its credibility comes from the freeze mechanism and independence declaration."

---

### Question 6a: "Okay, but if it's just 'documentation', why not just use our own internal records? What makes this more credible?"

**Response:**
"Internal records lack the independence declaration and cryptographic verification. This record includes a SHA-256 hash that anyone can verify independently.

Also, the freeze mechanism is explicit and documented. Once you confirm, the record is frozen with a timestamp. That creates a clear chain of custody that internal processes typically don't have."

---

### Question 7: "What if you make an error in the record?"

**Response:**
"If an error is discovered after freeze, we create a new record. The original record remains unchanged — that's the freeze mechanism.

Before freeze, you review and confirm everything. Once you confirm, it's frozen. If you find an error before confirming, we correct it. After freeze, corrections require a new record."

---

### Question 8: "What's your liability if something goes wrong?"

**Response:**
"Our liability is limited to the fees paid for the specific record. We don't provide legal, HR, or organisational advice. We create documentary records from information you supply and confirm.

The service agreement makes this clear. We're a press, not a consultancy or legal service."

---

## Role 3: CFO / Finance

### Question 9: "What's the ROI on this? How do we measure value?"

**Response:**
"This isn't an ROI service. It's insurance against reinterpretation.

The value is preventing training from being retroactively judged against outcomes it wasn't designed to achieve. If that happens, the cost of defending or correcting can far exceed £500.

But we don't measure or guarantee outcomes. We document intent and boundaries."

---

### Question 10: "Why not just do this annually or quarterly?"

**Response:**
"This is per-programme, not periodic. Each training programme gets its own record if you want one.

Some programmes need this protection, others don't. You decide per programme. There's no subscription or ongoing commitment."

---

### Question 11: "Can we get a discount for multiple programmes?"

**Response:**
"The price is £500 per programme record. Consistency in pricing maintains credibility.

If you have multiple programmes, we can process them sequentially, but each record is independent and priced separately."

---

### Question 9a: "But you can't prove it prevented anything. How do I know it's worth it?"

**Response:**
"You're right — we can't prove prevention. This is insurance, not a guarantee.

The value is only realized if training gets reinterpreted later. If that happens, the cost of defending or correcting can far exceed £500. But if it never happens, you've paid for protection you didn't need.

That's the nature of preventive documentation. You decide if the risk justifies the cost."

---

## Role 4: Hostile Investigator Scenario

### Question 12: "This looks like you're trying to cover something up. Why create a record if there's nothing to hide?"

**Response:**
"This isn't about hiding anything. It's about preventing misinterpretation.

Training often gets reinterpreted after the fact — when outcomes don't match expectations, or when incidents occur. This record preserves what training was intended to do and what it was not intended to guarantee, at the time it was delivered.

That prevents hindsight bias from rewriting history."

---

### Question 13: "If training was effective, why do you need to document what it wasn't supposed to do?"

**Response:**
"Effectiveness isn't what we document. We document intent and boundaries.

Training can be effective for its intended purpose but still get blamed for things it wasn't designed to address. This record prevents that drift.

We don't assess effectiveness. We document scope."

---

### Question 14: "Who are you to create 'assurance' records? What are your qualifications?"

**Response:**
"We're an independent press, not an assurance body. We create documentary records, not certifications.

The 'assurance' is procedural — it assures that intent and boundaries are preserved at a point in time. We don't certify competence, effectiveness, or compliance.

Our role is documentation, not evaluation."

---

### Question 15: "What if we disagree with what you've written in the record?"

**Response:**
"You review and confirm everything before freeze. If you disagree, you don't confirm, and we correct it.

Once you confirm, it's frozen. After that, if you discover an error, we create a new record. The original remains unchanged.

The record is built from information you supply. We don't interpret or add content."

---

### Question 15a: "But you're the one creating the record. How do we know you're not just writing what the client wants?"

**Response:**
"The record is built from information you supply, but you confirm its accuracy before freeze. We don't write what you want — we document what you confirm is accurate.

The freeze mechanism means once you confirm, nothing changes. If you later realize something was wrong, we create a new record. The original remains as evidence of what was confirmed at that time.

The independence declaration makes clear we're not providing advice or interpretation — just documentation."

---

## General Boundary Questions

### Question 16: "Can you help us improve our training based on what you see?"

**Response:**
"No. We don't design, deliver, or evaluate training. We document what was intended and delivered.

We're a press, not a consultancy. We assemble records from your materials. We don't provide advice or recommendations."

---

### Question 17: "What if we want you to assess whether the training worked?"

**Response:**
"We don't assess effectiveness or outcomes. That's outside our scope.

If you need evaluation, that's a different service. We only document intent, delivery, and boundaries."

---

### Question 18: "Can you certify that our training meets compliance requirements?"

**Response:**
"No. We don't certify anything. We create documentary records.

Compliance certification is a separate matter for your compliance team or external auditors. We document what training was intended to do, not whether it meets requirements."

---

## Closing Responses

### If they say: "I need to think about it."

**Response:**
"Of course. The record is available whenever you need it. There's no urgency or pressure."

---

### If they say: "This seems unnecessary."

**Response:**
"It may be unnecessary for your situation. This service is for organisations that want fixed, independent records to prevent reinterpretation.

If that's not a concern, you may not need it. We don't push or persuade."

---

### If they say: "Can you customise this for us?"

**Response:**
"We don't customise the structure. Consistency is what makes records credible.

The content comes from your information, but the structure is fixed. That's the press model."
