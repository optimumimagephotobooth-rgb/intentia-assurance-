# Mock Client Q&A - Locked Responses

This document contains exact responses to hard questions, tested and locked.

**Principle:** Calm, direct, boundary-maintaining. No overselling, no defensiveness.

**The One Sentence to Memorise:**
"We don't improve the story — we freeze the version that existed."

---

## Role 1: Sceptical HR Director

### Question 1: "Why would we pay for this? Isn't this just paperwork?"

**Correct Answer (use this wording):**
"It is paperwork — but it's independent paperwork created at the right moment.

Most organisations only try to document training after questions arise. By then, language drifts and intent gets rewritten.

We prevent that by fixing the record before hindsight sets in."

**Why this works:**
You're not denying it's paperwork. You're explaining why timing + independence matter.

---

### Question 2: "We already have training records internally."

**Correct Answer:**
"Most organisations do — but internal records are usually written by people who later become stakeholders in what the training is said to mean.

Our role is to create a neutral, external record that doesn't evolve with internal pressures."

**Key framing:**
Internal = interested party
External = calmer under scrutiny

---

## Role 2: Legal / Compliance Lead

### Question 3: "Could this be used against us in a dispute?"

**Correct Answer:**
"It could be referenced, yes — but it can't be reinterpreted or expanded.

The record is deliberately limited: it documents intent, delivery, and explicit non-guarantees.

That typically reduces exposure rather than increases it."

**Why this is strong:**
You acknowledge risk without defensiveness, then show containment.

---

### Question 4: "Are you giving legal advice?"

**Correct Answer (very important):**
"No. We don't interpret law, policy, or outcomes.

We produce a procedural record based on information you provide and confirm. Nothing more."

**Never add anything after that sentence.**

---

### Question 5: "Can this be used in court or tribunal proceedings?"

**Response:**
"The record can be submitted as evidence, but we don't guarantee its admissibility or weight. That's a legal question for your legal advisors.

What we provide is a fixed, independently verifiable record with a cryptographic hash. Its credibility comes from the freeze mechanism and independence declaration."

---

## Role 3: CFO / Budget Holder

### Question 6: "£500 feels high for a document."

**Correct Answer:**
"The cost reflects independence, finality, and credibility under scrutiny — not page count.

This is usually purchased to avoid much larger costs later."

**Then stop talking.**

**Why silence matters:**
CFOs understand risk pricing. Over-explaining weakens you.

---

### Question 7: "Is this a one-off or ongoing?"

**Correct Answer:**
"It's per programme. No subscription. No lock-in."

This is reassuring, not limiting.

---

### Question 8: "What's the ROI on this? How do we measure value?"

**Response:**
"This isn't an ROI service. It's insurance against reinterpretation.

The value is preventing training from being retroactively judged against outcomes it wasn't designed to achieve. If that happens, the cost of defending or correcting can far exceed £500.

But we don't measure or guarantee outcomes. We document intent and boundaries."

---

## Role 4: L&D Lead (Most Dangerous Role)

### Question 9: "Will this make my team look exposed if outcomes aren't great?"

**Correct Answer:**
"No — it usually does the opposite.

It makes clear what the training was and was not responsible for.

That boundary is often missing."

**This is where you win allies.**

---

### Question 10: "Can we tweak the language to sound safer?"

**Correct Answer (non-negotiable):**
"No — consistency and neutrality are what give the record credibility.

If the language is softened, the value is lost."

**Say this gently, but firmly.**

---

## Role 5: Procurement

### Question 11: "Why can't we do this ourselves?"

**Correct Answer:**
"You can — but the moment it's internal, it stops being independent.

Most organisations come to us precisely because they don't want that conflict."

**This reframes outsourcing as a feature, not a weakness.**

---

## Role 6: Hostile Scenario (Investigation / Tribunal Context)

### Question 12: "You trained these leaders — shouldn't they have known better?"

**Correct Answer:**
"This record shows what training exposed participants to and what it did not claim to ensure.

It does not certify competence or predict behaviour."

**This is where the counterfactual boundary does its job.**

---

### Question 13: "This looks like you're trying to cover something up. Why create a record if there's nothing to hide?"

**Response:**
"This isn't about hiding anything. It's about preventing misinterpretation.

Training often gets reinterpreted after the fact — when outcomes don't match expectations, or when incidents occur. This record preserves what training was intended to do and what it was not intended to guarantee, at the time it was delivered.

That prevents hindsight bias from rewriting history."

---

### Question 14: "Who are you to create 'assurance' records? What are your qualifications?"

**Response:**
"We're an independent press, not an assurance body. We create documentary records, not certifications.

The 'assurance' is procedural — it assures that intent and boundaries are preserved at a point in time. We don't certify competence, effectiveness, or compliance.

Our role is documentation, not evaluation."

---

## Role 7: The Most Important Question

### Question 15: "What exactly do we get at the end?"

**Correct Answer:**
"A standalone, final PDF record that captures intent, delivery, boundaries, and integrity — designed to stand on its own years later."

**If they ask "no portal?"**

**You answer:**
"Correct. The PDF is the product."

---

## What Your Wife Must NEVER Say

**She must not say:**

- "This protects you legally"
- "This guarantees safety"
- "This proves compliance"
- "This shows you did the right thing"
- "This will help you win a case"

**Those create liability.**

---

## General Boundary Questions

### Question 16: "Can you help us improve our training based on what you see?"

**Response:**
"No. We don't design, deliver, or evaluate training. We document what was intended and delivered.

We're a press, not a consultancy. We assemble records from your materials. We don't provide advice or recommendations."

---

### Question 17: "What if we want you to assess whether the training worked?"

**Response:**
"We don't assess effectiveness or outcomes. That's outside our scope.

If you need evaluation, that's a different service. We only document intent, delivery, and boundaries."

---

### Question 18: "Can you certify that our training meets compliance requirements?"

**Response:**
"No. We don't certify anything. We create documentary records.

Compliance certification is a separate matter for your compliance team or external auditors. We document what training was intended to do, not whether it meets requirements."

---

### Question 19: "Can you customise this for us?"

**Response:**
"We don't customise the structure. Consistency is what makes records credible.

The content comes from your information, but the structure is fixed. That's the press model."

---

## Closing Responses

### If they say: "I need to think about it."

**Response:**
"Of course. The record is available whenever you need it. There's no urgency or pressure."

---

### If they say: "This seems unnecessary."

**Response:**
"It may be unnecessary for your situation. This service is for organisations that want fixed, independent records to prevent reinterpretation.

If that's not a concern, you may not need it. We don't push or persuade."

---

## Final Confidence Check

**If she can:**

- answer calmly
- not oversell
- not get defensive
- not fill silence
- repeat the same phrasing

**Then Intentia Assurance is ready for real clients.**
