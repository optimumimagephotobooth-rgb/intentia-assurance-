# Simulation — Pushy Procurement Call

**Context:** HR sponsor wants you. Procurement joins late to "standardise."

**Call length:** 15 minutes, realistic

**Operator mindset:** Hold posture. Don't drift.

---

## OPENING

**Procurement:**
"We need to understand what you're selling and how it fits our supplier framework."

**You (verbatim):**
"We provide an independent assurance record. It's a fixed, standalone PDF. There's no platform, subscription, or ongoing service."

**Stop.**

---

## PRESSURE #1 — "What outcomes do you guarantee?"

**Procurement:**
"What outcomes does this deliver?"

**You:**
"None. We don't assess outcomes. We document intent, delivery, and boundaries."

**Stop.**

---

## PRESSURE #2 — "Where's the portal / dashboard?"

**Procurement:**
"How do we access it—portal, dashboard, API?"

**You:**
"You receive a final PDF. That is the product."

**Stop.**

---

## PRESSURE #3 — "Can we edit after review?"

**Procurement:**
"We'll need a review loop."

**You:**
"You review before freeze. After freeze, nothing changes. Corrections require a new record."

**Stop.**

---

## PRESSURE #4 — "Can we bundle / discount?"

**Procurement:**
"What if we do volume?"

**You:**
"Pricing is per record."

**Silence.**

---

## PRESSURE #5 — "What standard do you meet?"

**Procurement:**
"Which standards do you comply with?"

**You:**
"We operate a documented press process: intake, confirmation, freeze, final artefact. We don't certify against standards."

**Stop.**

---

## CLOSE (If they persist)

**You:**
"If a fixed, independent record fits your need, we can proceed. If you need evaluation, dashboards, or edits after the fact, we're not the right service."

**That's the line. Hold it.**
