# Intentia Assurance

Intentia Assurance is an independent assurance press that produces time-bound, neutral records of organisational training programmes.

## What Intentia Assurance Does

Intentia Assurance creates fixed, standalone PDF assurance records that capture:

- what a training programme was intended to do
- what was delivered
- what it was not intended to guarantee

These records are designed to remain credible under audit, grievance, investigation, or dispute.

## What Intentia Assurance Is Not

Intentia Assurance does not:

- design or deliver training
- assess effectiveness or impact
- certify competence or capability
- provide legal, HR, or organisational advice
- evaluate participants or outcomes

## The Press Model

Intentia Assurance operates as a press:

1. Structured intake of information and materials
2. Client confirmation of accuracy
3. Record freeze (no further changes permitted)
4. Mechanical assembly of a final artefact
5. Delivery of a standalone PDF record

Once frozen, records cannot be edited. Corrections require a new record.

## Output

The primary output is a standalone PDF assurance pack.
Optional appendices may be provided as ZIP files.

Each record includes:
- an independence declaration
- a documented chain of custody
- a counterfactual boundary statement
- an operator restraint statement
- a cryptographic integrity fingerprint (SHA-256)

## Purpose

Intentia Assurance exists to prevent training from being reinterpreted after the fact.

It preserves intent, scope, and boundaries at a moment in time — nothing more, nothing less.
