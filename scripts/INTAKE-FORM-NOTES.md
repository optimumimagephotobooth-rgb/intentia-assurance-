# Intake Form — Confirmed, Not Built

**You are correct to not build the Google Form yet.**

---

## Why Delay Building Forms

**Early intakes benefit from friction**

- Live typing reinforces restraint
- Forms invite "helpful" overthinking
- You don't yet know what to standardise

---

## Forms Come Only After

- 10+ identical intakes
- Zero wording drift
- No clarification emails needed

**Until then, manual intake maintains discipline.**
