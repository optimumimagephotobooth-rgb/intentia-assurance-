## What Intentia Assurance Does Not Do

Intentia Assurance explicitly does not:

- **Assess effectiveness** - We do not evaluate whether training achieved its goals
- **Certify competence** - We do not certify that participants gained competence or capability
- **Provide legal or HR advice** - We do not provide legal, HR, or organisational advice
- **Interpret incidents** - We do not interpret or assess incidents, grievances, or disputes
- **Evaluate participants** - We do not evaluate individual participants or outcomes
- **Design or deliver training** - We do not design, develop, or deliver training programmes
- **Assess impact** - We do not measure or assess impact or effectiveness
- **Provide ongoing monitoring** - We do not provide ongoing monitoring or updates

This file protects boundaries more than any contract.

## Boundaries

- **Time-bound:** Records capture a specific programme at a specific time
- **Scope-bound:** Only what was intended and delivered, nothing more
- **Frozen:** Once confirmed, no modifications permitted
- **Standalone:** Records are self-contained and independently verifiable

## Future Use Cases

Additional use cases will be defined only after this first use case is operational and proven.
