## What Intentia Assurance Does Not Do

Intentia Assurance explicitly does not:

- **Assess effectiveness or impact** – We do not evaluate whether training achieved goals or produced outcomes
- **Certify competence** – We do not certify that participants gained competence or capability
- **Provide legal or HR advice** – We do not provide legal, HR, or organisational advice
- **Interpret incidents** – We do not interpret or assess incidents, grievances, or disputes
- **Evaluate participants** – We do not evaluate individual participants
- **Design or deliver training** – We do not design, develop, or deliver training programmes
- **Provide ongoing monitoring** – We do not provide ongoing monitoring or updates

This document defines the operational boundaries of the service and is authoritative for scope interpretation.

## Boundaries

- **Time-bound:** Records capture a specific programme at a specific time
- **Scope-bound:** Limited strictly to stated intent and documented delivery
- **Frozen:** Once confirmed, no modifications permitted
- **Standalone:** Records are self-contained and independently verifiable

## Future Use Cases

Additional use cases will be defined only after this first use case is operational and proven.
