# Press Rules

## Core Principles

Intentia Assurance operates as a press, not a consultancy or evaluation service.

### Rule 1: Mechanical Assembly
Records are assembled from client-provided materials. We do not interpret, evaluate, or assess.

### Rule 2: Freeze on Confirmation
Once a client confirms accuracy, the record is frozen. No further changes are permitted.

### Rule 3: Independence
We declare our independence and do not provide training, assessment, or advice.

### Rule 4: Counterfactual Boundaries
Every record explicitly states what it does not guarantee or claim.

### Rule 5: Chain of Custody
All materials and processes are documented to establish a clear chain of custody.

### Rule 6: Integrity Fingerprint
Every record includes a cryptographic hash (SHA-256) for independent verification.

### Rule 7: Corrections Require New Records
If errors are found after freeze, a new record must be created. Original records are never modified.

### Rule 8: No Retroactive Interpretation
Records capture intent and scope at a moment in time. They cannot be reinterpreted after the fact.
