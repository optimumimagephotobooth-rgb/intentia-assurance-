# Press Rules

## The Press Process (Non-Negotiable)

**Intake → Freeze → Output**

This sequence is fixed and must not be altered.

1. **Intake:** Structured collection of information and materials as provided by the client, without validation or interpretation.
2. **Freeze:** Client confirmation of accuracy. The record is locked. No further changes are permitted.
3. **Output:** Deterministic, mechanical assembly of a final PDF artefact. No interpretation, no judgement.

## Core Principles

Intentia Assurance operates as a press, not a consultancy or evaluation service.

### Rule 1: Mechanical Assembly
Records are assembled from client-provided materials as provided and confirmed. We do not interpret, evaluate, or assess.

### Rule 2: Freeze on Confirmation
Once a client confirms accuracy, the record is frozen. No further changes are permitted. This is the press trigger.

### Rule 3: No Edits After Freeze
Frozen records cannot be edited. Corrections require a new record. Original records are never modified.

### Rule 4: PDF is Final Artefact
The PDF is the final, standalone record and does not rely on any external system, portal, or live reference. No outcomes, no judgement, no interpretation.

### Rule 5: Independence
We declare our independence from the client, facilitators, participants, and vendors, and do not provide training, assessment, or advice.

### Rule 6: Counterfactual Boundaries
Every record explicitly states what it does not guarantee or claim.

### Rule 7: Chain of Custody
All materials and procedural steps are recorded to establish a clear, documented chain of custody.

### Rule 8: Integrity Fingerprint
Every record includes a cryptographic hash (SHA-256) for independent verification of document integrity. This does not attest to accuracy, truth, or outcomes.

### Rule 9: No Retroactive Interpretation
Records capture intent and scope at a moment in time and are not reinterpreted, expanded, or contextualised by Intentia Assurance after generation.
