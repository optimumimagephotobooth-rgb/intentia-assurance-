# Press Rules

## The Press Process (Non-Negotiable)

**Intake → Freeze → Output**

This sequence is fixed. Nothing happens out of order.

1. **Intake:** Structured collection of information and materials from client
2. **Freeze:** Client confirmation of accuracy. Record is locked. No further changes permitted.
3. **Output:** Mechanical assembly of final PDF artefact. No interpretation, no judgement.

## Core Principles

Intentia Assurance operates as a press, not a consultancy or evaluation service.

### Rule 1: Mechanical Assembly
Records are assembled from client-provided materials. We do not interpret, evaluate, or assess.

### Rule 2: Freeze on Confirmation
Once a client confirms accuracy, the record is frozen. No further changes are permitted. This is the press trigger.

### Rule 3: No Edits After Freeze
Frozen records cannot be edited. Corrections require a new record. Original records are never modified.

### Rule 4: PDF is Final Artefact
The PDF is the final, standalone record. No outcomes, no judgement, no interpretation.

### Rule 5: Independence
We declare our independence and do not provide training, assessment, or advice.

### Rule 6: Counterfactual Boundaries
Every record explicitly states what it does not guarantee or claim.

### Rule 7: Chain of Custody
All materials and processes are documented to establish a clear chain of custody.

### Rule 8: Integrity Fingerprint
Every record includes a cryptographic hash (SHA-256) for independent verification.

### Rule 9: No Retroactive Interpretation
Records capture intent and scope at a moment in time. They cannot be reinterpreted after the fact.
