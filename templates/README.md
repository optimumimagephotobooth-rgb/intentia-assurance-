## Programme Decision Record (PDR)

**Files:** 
- `programme-decision-record-template.md` (markdown reference)
- `programme-decision-record-word-version.txt` (copy-paste ready for Word/Google Docs)

**Purpose:** Second press - preserves why a training programme was commissioned before outcomes exist.

**Use:** When documenting the decision to commission training (before delivery begins).

**When to Offer:** Only after first Training Assurance Pack is delivered and client trusts the press. Never lead with PDR.

**Pricing:** £750–£1,000 (higher than Training Assurance Pack due to board-level value and pre-event protection)

**Sections:** Fixed order - see template for details.
