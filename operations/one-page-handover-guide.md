# Intentia Assurance — One-Page Handover Guide

**Operator-to-Operator Transfer**

**Purpose:** Allow any trained operator to run the press without interpretation, redesign, or supervision.

---

## 1️⃣ WHAT THIS SERVICE IS (Read Once)

**Intentia Assurance is a press, not a consultancy.**

**We:**

- record intent and boundaries
- freeze understanding in time
- produce a final, standalone PDF
- do not assess, advise, or improve

**If unsure at any point, default to recording less, not more.**

---

## 2️⃣ THE NON-NEGOTIABLE SEQUENCE

**Always follow this order:**

**Intake → Confirmation → Freeze → Assemble → PDF → Hash → Archive**

**If this sequence is broken, stop and correct before continuing.**

---

## 3️⃣ WHICH PRESS AM I RUNNING?

**Check before intake:**

**Training Assurance Pack**
- Used after training delivery
- Documents intent + delivery + boundaries

**Programme Decision Record**
- Used before delivery or at commissioning
- Documents decision context + intent

**Never mix the two.**

---

## 4️⃣ INTAKE RULES (Critical)

**During intake:**

- Read questions verbatim
- Type exactly what is said
- Do not paraphrase
- Do not suggest wording
- Do not react

**If asked for opinion:**

"We don't assess or advise — we only record."

---

## 5️⃣ FREEZE RULE (This protects everything)

**A record is frozen only when:**

- client confirms accuracy in writing

**After freeze:**

- ❌ no edits
- ❌ no additions
- ❌ no clarifications

**Corrections = new record.**

---

## 6️⃣ ASSEMBLY RULES

- Use the correct template
- Keep section order unchanged
- Insert content mechanically
- If language feels "helpful", remove it

**Remember:**

**Helpful language = liability**

---

## 7️⃣ FINALISATION CHECKLIST

**Before delivery, confirm:**

- [ ] PDF exported
- [ ] SHA-256 hash generated
- [ ] Hash inserted
- [ ] FINAL PDF re-hashed and matched
- [ ] Archive folder complete

**If any step fails → restart calmly.**

---

## 8️⃣ DELIVERY RULE

**Send:**

- FINAL PDF
- Appendices (if applicable)

**Do not:**

- explain
- justify
- upsell
- request feedback

**Silence is correct.**

---

## 9️⃣ REFUSAL RULES (When to Say No)

**Refuse if:**

- outcomes are already known (for PDR)
- client wants wording improved
- client wants backdating
- client wants evaluation or endorsement

**Use:**

"That wouldn't be appropriate for this service."

**Then stop.**

---

## 🔟 PRICING (Do Not Deviate)

**Training Assurance Pack:** £500

**Programme Decision Record:** £900

**No discounts.**
**Reduce scope, not price.**

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ WHEN IN DOUBT

**Ask one question:**

"Am I preserving intent, or improving it?"

**If improving → stop.**

---

## OPERATOR MANTRA (Read Daily)

**"I record.**
**I freeze.**
**I do not explain."**

**That's it.**

---

**If both of you can follow this page, the press survives:**

- stress
- growth
- absence
- time
