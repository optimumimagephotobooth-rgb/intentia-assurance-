# One-Page Operator's Day Flow

**Intentia Assurance — Daily Operating Guide**

This is the page your wife can keep open while working. No thinking. Just follow.

---

## 🕘 START OF DAY (5 minutes)

**Check once:**

- [ ] Inbox (client confirmations only)
- [ ] Archive folder status
- [ ] Today's case reference IDs

**Do not:**

- review pricing
- revisit doctrine

---

## 🧩 IF TODAY INCLUDES AN INTAKE CALL

### Before the call (5 minutes)

- [ ] Open the correct intake document
- [ ] Open the correct press template
- [ ] Have the opening sentence visible

**Remind yourself:**

"I record. I do not advise."

### During the call (15–20 minutes)

- [ ] Read questions verbatim
- [ ] Type exactly what is said
- [ ] Do not summarise
- [ ] Do not react
- [ ] Let silence sit

**If asked for opinion:**

"We don't assess or advise — we only record."

### After the call (10 minutes)

- [ ] Clean spelling only (no wording changes)
- [ ] Prepare the freeze confirmation email
- [ ] Send it the same day

---

## 🔒 IF A FREEZE CONFIRMATION IS RECEIVED

### Immediate actions (no delay)

- [ ] Record freeze date & time
- [ ] Lock intake document
- [ ] Do not accept further input

**Rule:**
Anything sent after freeze belongs to a new record.

---

## 🧱 IF BUILDING THE PDF TODAY

### Assembly (30–45 minutes)

- [ ] Populate template mechanically
- [ ] Do not "improve" phrasing
- [ ] Follow section order strictly
- [ ] Export to PDF
- [ ] Use naming convention
- [ ] Save as non-FINAL

---

## 🔐 HASH & FINALISE (10 minutes)

- [ ] Generate SHA-256 hash
- [ ] Insert hash into document
- [ ] Export FINAL PDF
- [ ] Re-hash FINAL PDF
- [ ] Confirm match

**If mismatch → restart calmly.**

---

## 🗂️ ARCHIVE (10 minutes)

- [ ] Create case folder
- [ ] Store:
  - intake
  - materials
  - FINAL PDF
  - metadata.txt

**Once archived, the case is closed.**

---

## 📤 DELIVERY TO CLIENT (5 minutes)

**Send:**

- FINAL PDF
- Appendices (if applicable)

**Do not:**

- explain
- justify
- upsell

---

## 🧠 END-OF-DAY CHECK (5 minutes)

**Answer internally:**

- [ ] Did we follow the sequence?
- [ ] Did we resist improving language?
- [ ] Did we stop thinking at freeze?

**If yes → day complete.**

---

## WHAT THE OPERATOR NEVER DOES

- Never revisits pricing
- Never edits after freeze
- Never reframes client language
- Never promises protection
- Never explains hashing unless asked
- Never asks for feedback

---

## THE OPERATOR MANTRA (Read once per day)

**"I preserve intent.**
**I do not improve it.**
**I do not explain it.**
**I freeze it."**

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

**This page:**

- turns infrastructure into habit
- allows scale without dilution
- protects credibility under pressure
- makes the service boringly reliable

**This is how serious B2B services endure.**
