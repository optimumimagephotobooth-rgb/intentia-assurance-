# Weekly Ops Review Ritual

**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Cadence:** Same day, same time, every week  
**Attendees:** Operators only (you + your wife)

**Fixed agenda — do not improvise**

---

## 1️⃣ Open the Dashboard (2 minutes)

**Look only at:**

- [ ] Cases closed this week
- [ ] Case statuses
- [ ] Any "No" flags

**No discussion yet.**

---

## 2️⃣ Integrity Sweep (3 minutes)

**Answer yes/no only for each closed case:**

- [ ] Freeze confirmed in writing?
- [ ] Zero post-freeze edits?
- [ ] FINAL PDF hash verified?
- [ ] Archive complete?

**If any "No" → name the step that failed. Do not explain.**

---

## 3️⃣ Drift Check (2 minutes)

**Answer once:**

"Did we feel any pressure to improve language or explain value?"

- [ ] No → move on
- [ ] Yes → note the exact moment (one sentence)

**No solutions yet.**

---

## 4️⃣ One Micro-Fix (2 minutes)

**Choose at most one:**

- [ ] Clarify a script line
- [ ] Tighten a checklist step
- [ ] Adjust timing (not scope)

**Never:**

- change templates weekly
- add features
- revisit pricing

---

## 5️⃣ Close (1 minute)

**Write one line in Operator Notes:**

"Week closed. No drift."

or

"Week closed. One micro-fix applied: [X]."

**Meeting ends.**

---

## RULES (Non-Negotiable)

- No performance metrics
- No client feedback discussion
- No roadmap
- No pricing talk
- No redesign

**This is process hygiene, not strategy.**

---

## SUCCESS SIGNALS

**You're doing it right if:**

- Reviews get shorter over time
- Templates rarely change
- Clients stop asking questions
- Legal stops pushing back
- Pricing conversations disappear

---

## OPTIONAL (Only After 4 Weeks)

**If operations feel calm, you may add one optional review item:**

"Any refusal we handled this week?"

**Record fact only. No judgement.**

---

## You're now in steady-state operation.

**From here, execution repeats:**

- Intake → Freeze → Output
- Weekly Ops Review
- Invoice → Archive
