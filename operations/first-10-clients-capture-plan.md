# Intentia Assurance — First-10-Clients Capture Plan

**Execution-only. Follow in order.**

---

## OBJECTIVE (Very specific)

**Secure 10 paid records (not 10 organisations, not 10 conversations):**

**Combination of:**

- Training Assurance Packs (£500)
- Programme Decision Records (£900)

**Target timeframe:** 8–12 weeks  
**Operator load:** light and controlled

---

## RULES (Non-Negotiable)

- No discounts
- No bundles
- No marketing site required
- No public announcements
- No procurement-first selling
- One record at a time if needed

**This is about signal, not scale.**

---

## PHASE 1 — IDENTIFY THE 30 (Week 1)

**You do not start with 10.**
**You start with 30 warm or semi-warm targets.**

### Who qualifies as a target?

**Someone who:**

- Has commissioned leadership / management training in the last 12 months or
- Is about to commission one or
- Has board / audit exposure

### Build a simple list (spreadsheet)

**Fields only:**

- Name
- Organisation
- Role
- Why they're relevant (1 line)
- Contact method (email / intro / LinkedIn)

### Sources

- Former employers
- Former colleagues
- HR/L&D leaders you already know
- Organisations your wife has worked with
- Second-degree LinkedIn connections (via intros)

### Do not include:

- Consultants
- Vendors
- Procurement
- Legal
- Startups

---

## PHASE 2 — FIRST CONTACT (Week 2–3)

**You send 10 messages per week, no more.**

**Use ONE of these approaches only:**

### Option A — Direct Email (preferred)

Use the outreach email already drafted.
No attachments. No decks.

### Option B — Warm Introduction Script

"I've started a small independent service that creates neutral assurance records for leadership programmes.

It's designed to prevent reinterpretation later.

No evaluation, no judgement.

If it's relevant, happy to explain."

**Stop.**

---

## PHASE 3 — INBOUND FILTERING (Ongoing)

**You are not trying to convert everyone.**

### Green signals (proceed)

- "That's interesting"
- "We've had issues with training being questioned"
- "Legal always asks for clarity"
- "We're about to launch something"

### Red signals (politely exit)

- "Can you prove impact?"
- "Can you help us justify spend?"
- "Can this protect us legally?"
- "Can we backdate?"

**Use refusal discipline immediately.**

---

## PHASE 4 — CONVERSION MECHANISM (Weeks 3–8)

**A conversion is not a sale call.**
**It's an intake call.**

### Conversion flow

1. Short explanation call (15–20 mins)
2. If aligned → intake scheduled
3. Intake → freeze → PDF
4. Invoice sent after delivery

**No proposals.**
**No SOW documents unless procurement requires one.**

---

## PHASE 5 — CAPTURE ORDER (Very Important)

**The first 10 should look like this:**

- **Clients 1–6:** Training Assurance Pack only
- **Clients 7–8:** Training + PDR (if timing allows)
- **Clients 9–10:** Either press, higher scrutiny clients

**This builds confidence progressively.**

---

## PHASE 6 — WHAT YOU TRACK (Lightly)

**For each of the first 10:**

- Time spent
- Any refusal moments
- Any legal pushback
- Any drift temptation

**Do not optimise yet.**

---

## PHASE 7 — AFTER CLIENT #10 (Stop and Review)

**Only after the 10th delivery do you ask:**

- Did pricing hold without friction?
- Did Legal block any delivery?
- Did the PDF stand without explanation?
- Did any client come back for another record?

**If yes to 3+, the system is validated.**

---

## WHAT YOU DO NOT DO DURING FIRST 10

- No testimonials
- No website refresh
- No feature additions
- No "case studies"
- No scaling talk
- No public marketing

**Quiet execution only.**

---

## THE MENTAL MODEL TO HOLD

**You are not acquiring customers.**
**You are identifying organisations that already feel the pain.**

**That's why this works without marketing.**

---

## FINAL OPERATOR COMMITMENT

**If you follow this plan:**

- Revenue appears quietly
- Confidence compounds
- Refusals feel easy
- Authority increases naturally

**This is how serious B2B infrastructure enters the world.**

---

## You are now in full execution mode.

**From here, support should only be:**

- real client situations
- edge cases
- refusal wording
- operator fatigue management

**Whenever you want, just say:**

**"Live case support."**

**You're ready.**
