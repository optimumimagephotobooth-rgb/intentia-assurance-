# Post-Delivery Review Checklist

**Run this after every delivery — no exceptions**

**This checklist is internal only. It is not shared with clients.**

---

## 1️⃣ Intake Discipline Check

**Ask (yes / no only):**

- [ ] Did we record intent verbatim?
- [ ] Did we avoid summarising or reframing?
- [ ] Were non-objectives explicitly stated?
- [ ] Did we avoid adding safety language?

**If any answer is no → note where drift occurred.**

---

## 2️⃣ Freeze Integrity Check

- [ ] Was confirmation received in writing?
- [ ] Was the freeze timestamp recorded?
- [ ] Were zero changes made after freeze?

**If any change occurred post-freeze → document why and correct the process.**

---

## 3️⃣ Template Fidelity Check

- [ ] Were all sections present?
- [ ] Were sections in the correct order?
- [ ] Was any wording improvised?
- [ ] Did any section feel "helpful" rather than neutral?

**If something felt helpful → that's a warning sign.**

---

## 4️⃣ Counterfactual Strength Check

**Read only the Counterfactual Boundary section.**

**Ask:**

- [ ] Does it clearly block capability inference?
- [ ] Does it block accountability inference?
- [ ] Does it block outcome attribution?

**If not → strengthen template, not delivery.**

---

## 5️⃣ Hash & Integrity Check

- [ ] Does the hash in the PDF match the FINAL file?
- [ ] Was the hash generated after final export?
- [ ] Is the archive complete?

**If mismatch → restart the hash flow.**

---

## 6️⃣ Client Reaction Signal (Do not interpret)

**Record only what they did, not what you felt.**

- [ ] Did they question wording?
- [ ] Did Legal push back?
- [ ] Did they treat the PDF as final?
- [ ] Did they ask for changes after delivery?

**Do not justify. Just record behaviour.**

---

## 7️⃣ Time & Effort Check

- [ ] Total time spent (minutes): _________
- [ ] Where did time concentrate?
- [ ] What slowed the process?

**You optimise time, never scope.**

---

## 8️⃣ Decision Gate (Important)

**Answer one question:**

**Would we deliver this again the same way?**

- [ ] Yes → lock the process
- [ ] No → fix one step only

**Never make multiple changes after one delivery.**

---

## WHAT YOU DO NOT DO AFTER DELIVERY

**Do not:**

- ask for testimonials
- ask "was this helpful?"
- explain future use cases
- upsell immediately
- justify the value

**Silence preserves authority.**

---

## OUTPUT OF THE CHECKLIST

**Each delivery produces:**

- 1 internal page of notes
- 0 client-facing changes (unless something broke)

**After 3 deliveries, patterns emerge.**
**That's when ops optimisation begins.**
