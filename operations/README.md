# Operations

This directory contains operational tools and checklists for running Intentia Assurance.

## Post-Delivery Review Checklist

**File:** `post-delivery-review-checklist.md`

**Purpose:** Run after every delivery to prevent silent drift and harden confidence.

**When to use:** Immediately after each delivery, before moving to the next client.

**Output:** 1 internal page of notes per delivery. After 3 deliveries, patterns emerge for ops optimisation.

## Operational Principles

- You optimise time, never scope
- Never make multiple changes after one delivery
- Silence preserves authority
- Infrastructure becomes valuable when it is boring to run
