# First Real Client Debrief — Simulation

**15 minutes, internal only**

**Rule: This is not a "feedback session." It's a fact review.**

---

## 1️⃣ Open the Case (2 minutes)

**Have these in front of you:**

- [ ] Case Reference ID
- [ ] FINAL PDF
- [ ] Ops dashboard row
- [ ] Post-delivery checklist

**No opinions yet.**

---

## 2️⃣ What Happened (Facts Only — 3 minutes)

**Answer only yes/no or dates:**

- [ ] Intake completed in one call?
- [ ] Freeze confirmed in writing same day?
- [ ] Any post-freeze requests?
- [ ] Legal reviewed the PDF?
- [ ] Any requested changes refused?
- [ ] FINAL delivered without revision?

**Record answers. No interpretation.**

---

## 3️⃣ Where Time Went (2 minutes)

**Write down:**

- Intake minutes: _________
- Assembly minutes: _________
- Hash/archive minutes: _________

**Question: Did time cluster anywhere unexpectedly?**

---

## 4️⃣ Doctrine Stress Points (4 minutes)

**Answer each yes/no:**

- [ ] Any urge to "improve" wording?
- [ ] Any pressure to edit after freeze?
- [ ] Any request that would break independence?
- [ ] Any explanation given that wasn't necessary?

**If yes, note the exact moment and phrase.**

---

## 5️⃣ Decision Gate (3 minutes)

**Choose one outcome:**

- [ ] **A. No change** — Process is locked
- [ ] **B. Micro-fix** — One procedural tweak (not template)
- [ ] **C. Stopgap** — Clarify a script or email wording

**Never choose more than one.**

---

## 6️⃣ Close (1 minute)

**Write a single line in Operator Notes:**

"Record delivered without changes. Legal reviewed. No drift."

**That's it. Case closed.**

---

## WHAT YOU DO NOT DO

- No client survey
- No "was this helpful?"
- No upsell
- No template edits unless something broke
- No pricing discussion

**Silence preserves authority.**

---

## PASS / FAIL

### PASS if:

- The PDF stood on its own
- No explanations were needed
- Pressure was refused calmly

### FAIL if:

- You explained value post-delivery
- You negotiated wording
- You promised protection

**If FAIL → fix script, not product.**
