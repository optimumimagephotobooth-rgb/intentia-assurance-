## C. Decision Intent

**(Highest-risk section — stay strict)**

6. **What was this decision intended to achieve or support at the time it was made?**

**If they list outcomes, you do not correct them.**
**You record as stated.**

**You may say once:**

"I'll capture that as stated."

## D. Explicit Non-Objectives

**(Critical for future protection)**

7. **What was this decision not intended to do?**
   - For example:
     - not intended to guarantee outcomes
     - not intended to replace accountability
     - not intended to address individual conduct

**If they struggle:**

"Non-objectives help prevent later reinterpretation."

**Then stop.**

---

## E. Alternatives Considered (Optional)

8. **Were any alternatives discussed or considered at the time?**
   - [ ] Yes
   - [ ] No

9. **If yes, what alternatives were considered?**

## F. Materials to Append

10. **What documents should form part of the record?**
    - (e.g. business case, board paper, proposal)

**If they say "everything":**

"We'll list categories rather than assert completeness."

---

## G. Confirmation & Freeze Setup

11. **Do you confirm that the information provided reflects the decision as understood at the time it was made?**

This sets up the freeze email.

---

## 🚫 What is explicitly NOT asked

**Forbidden questions:**

- "Was this the right decision?"
- "What happened later?"
- "Would you do this again?"
- "Did it work?"
- "Who disagreed?"

Those are forbidden.
